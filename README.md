# NFTSeum


Heard of Instagram? Well, we redefined it for NFTs
It looks a lot like instagram so you can get around easily.

## Techonologies
As you can already guess, this app is a decentralized app or dapp. We used React and Node for the frontend and backend respectively. We also used the [Moralis API](https://moralis.io) and the [ethers](https://ethers.io/#!/app-link/welcome.ethers.space/) library for this project. We use the blockchain technology.

<h5>Disclaimer</h5>

> Unfortunately, we couldn't complete the entire project. This was a pretty big project for us to take on in under 2 days, especially with technologies with which we had almost no experience working with.
